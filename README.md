## About

This repository is a collection of my solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Each solution is organized by problem type or study plan and includes the problem description, my approach, and the code implementation.

## Solutions Structure

The solutions are organized into different folders based on the programming language and study plans:

- **Programming Languages**: Solutions are categorized by the language used, such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and SQL.
- **Study Plans**: Solutions are also organized based on specific study plans like SQL 50.

## How to Use

To view a solution, navigate to the relevant folder and open the file corresponding to the problem you're interested in. Each solution file includes the problem description, my thought process, and the code implementation.

## Study Plans

I am working on several LeetCode study plans to systematically improve my problem-solving skills. Here are some of the study plans I am following:

- **SQL 50**: A collection of 50 SQL problems designed to improve SQL query skills.
- **Other Study Plans**: More study plans as I progress.

Each study plan has its own folder in the repository.

## Languages Used

I use various programming languages to solve these problems, including but not limited to:

- Python
- C++
- Rust
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL

The language used for each solution is indicated by the file extension, for example, `Problem_1_Two_Sum.py` for a Python solution or `Problem_175_Combine_Two_Tables.sql` for a SQL solution.
